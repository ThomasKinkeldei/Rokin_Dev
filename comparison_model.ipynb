Remember that it is the software that really powers the 3D scanner, and an advanced 3D scanner that captures objects of various sizes demands powerful 3D software. 3D scanners that accurately capture both the texture and geometry of an object will produce 3D models that can be sent straight to a color printer\n\n\nlink7\nSummarized Text: \n Benefits of Using a VFD in Place of an RVSS For many, perhaps most users, the primary benefit of VFD is 100% starting torque at 100% current (no inrush) versus 32% starting torque and 200% inrush typical of an RVSS at 40% starting voltage. (Image courtesy of Parker Hannifin.) Solid state reduced voltage starters convert fixed voltage/frequency into variable voltage at fixed frequency to start 3-phase induction motors, after which the bypass contactor shunts the RVSS, directly connecting the motor to the main AC input supply. The VFD applies both a variable voltage and a variable frequency to the motor\n\n\nlink8\nSummarized Text: \n Using hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), a material used in thin-film silicon solar cells, and the associated Staebler-Wronski effect (SWE), which describes how the optical properties of a-Si:H can be changed via light exposure or heating, researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology have designed a new PIC fabrication process that addresses the shortfalls of current techniques and could lead to the emergence of universal programmable PICs. Optical materials with adjustable refractive index are essential for reconfigurable PICs as they allow for more accurate manipulation of light passing through the materials, leading to better PIC performance. Researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology have devised a new process for the fabrication of PICs that addresses these critical issues, by creating novel reconfigurable PICs in the same way that the emergence of programmable logic devices transformed IC production in the 1980s\n\n\nlink9\nSummarized Text: \n fusion and plasma physics community to take bold steps to make fusion energy a reality, to expand our understanding of plasma physics, and to use that understanding to benefit society,\" said physicist Nathan Ferraro of the U.S. The report, the Community Plan for Fusion Energy and Discovery Plasma Sciences, \"reflects the enthusiasm among the U.S. A landmark plan for realizing fusion energy and advancing plasma science by John Greenwald, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory PPPL physicist Nathan Ferraro with image from cover of report behind him\n\n\nlink10\nSummarized Text: \n High-speed microscope captures fleeting brain signals by University of California - Berkeley Using a wide-field 'mesoscope,' UC Berkeley researchers were able to image neurons (green) in a large chunk of the cortex of the brain of a living mouse.

The French have dominated the realm of fragrance since the 16th century. Perfume making is indeed a craft that requires heightened sensory perception. E-nose recognizes a range of smells and collects information on them to run algorithms that track the source. How is an e-nose particularly helpful? Firstly, it can be integrated into many other devices, which can enhance its overall function to include many more features. A robot or software can handle the ingredients more deftly and precisely. Therefore, they do not, in any way, invalidate the skills of a perfumer.\n\n\nlink2\nSummarized Text: \n  This could prove to be highly advantageous for an industry for which consistency in size and fitting is vital. An increase in the cost of manufacturing is duly reflected in the retail cost of the apparel.

Proponents of AI say that although the complete transition could take up to a decade, it is, however, inevitable.\n\n\nlink3\nSummarized Text: \n  There is no FRL to connect, no manifold to mount, and no airlines to route.

They could also do such specific and repetitive tasks as welding. This same revolution also ushered in the first automated guided vehicles to manufacturing plants and warehouse facilities. Moreover, many of them have heads that move and rotate on a neck. Lidar offers high resolution 3D mapping capabilities, but it is currently very expensive. This said, Lidar costs are dropping and there are a number of companies working diligently to produce even lower cost Lidar solutions. Moreover they can play a role in the robot performing its major functional tasks. They are relatively low cost and have good accuracy at close ranges, but their accuracy drops off with increasing range and measurement angle. However, they are also now found in other parts of the robot, such as in their arms, legs and torso.\n\n\nlink5\nSummarized Text: \n  Robots evolve with many cutting-edge technologies.

Often the answer is 3D scanning. Why Choose 3D Scanning for Additive Manufacturing? And merely reproducing the object is just the start. It’s also a much faster method. The benefits of 3D scanning are many. Like shoes and clothes, 3D scanners are not one-size-fits-all. The faster that an object can be scanned translates into more of it being scanned.

The French have dominated the realm of fragrance since the 16th century. Perfume making is indeed a craft that requires heightened sensory perception. E-nose recognizes a range of smells and collects information on them to run algorithms that track the source. How is an e-nose particularly helpful? Firstly, it can be integrated into many other devices, which can enhance its overall function to include many more features. A robot or software can handle the ingredients more deftly and precisely.
